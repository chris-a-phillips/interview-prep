    <br/>

This is a simple MERN application for testing your knowledge of general concepts based around software engineering.

The main functionality includes:
* Frontend React app styled using basic CSS for a glassmorphism effect
* Frontend that is connected to backend using axios with functionality to create and read data using RESTful routes
* Backend Express using Mongoose for schemas to questions

This can be used for anyone on their journey in software engineering. Although it was created with the purpose of preparing for interviews, it can be used as a way to do basic trivia. It was created with frontend, backend, behavioral, and whiteboarding questions in mind. It will continue to grow with questions about different topics and more ways to visualize the information.


### Built With

* [Express](https://expressjs.com/)
